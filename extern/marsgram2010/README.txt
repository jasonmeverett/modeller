NOTE: Text files provided on the distribution CD have end-of-line marks in PC
      format.  These may need to be converted to end-of-line marks on your non-PC
      platform.  FTP file transfer to your target platform from the CD, read on a PC, 
      can make the transform, if the FTP file transfer is done in ASCII mode.  On-line 
      or GNU utilities are also available that can perform this end-of-line transform 
      for you.
